        <h1>Assignment: Blockchain Technology in Audit Practice</h1>
        <h2>Context:</h2>
        <p>
            As emerging technologies continue to shape the accounting industry, blockchain stands out for its potential 
            to revolutionize the way transactions are recorded and verified. This technology offers auditors a new tool 
            to enhance the audit process. In this assignment, you will interact with a simple blockchain application that 
            records transactions of students enrolling in courses.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Understand the Application:</strong> 
                Begin by studying the Python code for the Blockchain and Block classes, and the Flask application. 
                This application uses a simplified model of a blockchain to record transactions. Each transaction 
                should include the names of a student and professor, and the name of a course.</li>
            <li><strong>Interact with the Blockchain:</strong>
                Use the form provided in the application to add new transactions to the blockchain. Note how each block added to the blockchain is immutable, meaning once a transaction has been recorded, it cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks.</li>
            <li><strong>Audit the Blockchain:</strong>
                Act as an auditor verifying the transactions recorded on the blockchain. Check the integrity of the blockchain by ensuring that the "previous_hash" of each block matches the "hash" of the previous block. This is one way auditors can verify the integrity of transactions recorded on a blockchain.</li>
            <li><strong>Identify Anomalies:</strong>
                Suppose an anomaly was detected in the blockchain. Discuss the steps you would take to investigate the issue. Consider how the immutability of the blockchain affects your investigation.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Discussion Questions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>How can the immutability of blockchain transactions improve the audit process?</li>
            <li>In what scenarios might blockchain technology be particularly useful in auditing?</li>
            <li>What challenges might auditors face when auditing transactions recorded on a blockchain?</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Rubric:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Understanding of Blockchain Technology (30 points):</strong> 
                Clear understanding of how the blockchain application works and its implications for auditing.</li>
            <li><strong>Interaction with the Blockchain (30 points):</strong>
                Successful interaction with the blockchain application, including adding transactions and checking the integrity of the blockchain.</li>
            <li><strong>Identification of Anomalies (20 points):</strong>
                Thoughtful discussion of how to investigate a hypothetical anomaly detected in the blockchain.</li>
            <li><strong>Discussion Questions (20 points):</strong>
                Insightful responses to the discussion questions, demonstrating a solid understanding of the implications of blockchain technology for auditing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Remember to include your findings and thought process in a written report. Your grade will depend on the depth 
            of your understanding, the quality of your work, and the insights you provide in your report. Good luck!
