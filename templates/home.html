        <h1>Welcome to the Blockchain Application</h1>
        <h2>Fictional Scenario: The Certification Transparency Initiative</h2>
        <p>As an esteemed institution, Fairview University is renowned for its rigorous academic programs and high standards. Upon successful completion of these programs, students are awarded certificates that attest to their academic achievements.</p> 
        <p>To enhance the trust and transparency associated with its certification process, Fairview University is implementing a new initiative: The Certification Transparency Initiative (CTI). Under this initiative, the university plans to record each student's certificate information on a blockchain. This approach ensures the immutability and verification of each certificate, enhancing their credibility and the university's accountability.</p>
        <p>Each certificate includes the student's name, the completed course, the professor who taught the course, and the date of completion. Upon completion of a course, this information is packaged as a 'block' and added to the university's blockchain.</p>
        <p>As part of this project, you, an auditing student, have been asked to participate in a simulation of this new system. You will interact with a simple blockchain application that records these 'certificate' transactions. Your task is to act as an auditor, add transactions, and verify the integrity of the data on the blockchain.</p>    
        <p>Through this process, you will gain a hands-on understanding of how blockchain technology can be used in an audit context, explore its potential benefits, and consider the challenges involved in auditing such an immutable system. You will also assess how blockchain technology can enhance trust and transparency in academic certification. </p>
